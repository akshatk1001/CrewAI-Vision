## VALIDATION SUMMARY [Fail] - The Mermaid code contains critical omissions and inaccuracies that compromise structural fidelity and connection representation.  

## COMPONENT VERIFICATION ✅ Verified components: [Amazon S3 Bucket, Amazon DynamoDB Table, Amazon EC2 Instance, Amazon ECS Cluster, Amazon CloudWatch Alarm, Amazon Elasticsearch Cluster, Amazon RDS Instance] ❌ Missing components: [AWS Service, Security Group] ⚠️ Misrepresented components: [AWS Service is represented as a subgraph node but lacks distinct identity; Security Group entirely omitted]  

## TEXT ACCURACY CHECK ✅ Correct labels: [Amazon S3 Bucket, Amazon DynamoDB Table, Amazon EC2 Instance, Amazon ECS Cluster, Amazon CloudWatch Alarm, Amazon Elasticsearch Cluster, Amazon RDS Instance] ❌ Missing text: [AWS Service, Security Group] ⚠️ Incorrect text: [All connections from AWS Service to other services lack red arrows; AWS Service is labeled as a subgraph node rather than a distinct component]  

## STRUCTURAL VALIDATION ✅ Properly represented structures: [Subgraphs for Data Storage, Compute Services, Monitoring and Observability] ❌ Missing organizational elements: [Security Group as a standalone subgraph; AWS Service as a distinct node; explicit grouping for security controls]  

## CONNECTION VERIFICATION ✅ Correctly mapped connections: [AmazonS3Bucket --(red arrow)--> AmazonDynamoDBTable, AmazonDynamoDBTable --(red arrow)--> AmazonEC2Instance, AmazonECSCluster --(red arrow)--> AmazonEC2Instance, AmazonCloudWatchAlarm --(red arrow)--> AmazonEC2Instance, AmazonElasticsearchCluster --(red arrow)--> AmazonS3Bucket, AmazonRDSInstance --(red arrow)--> AmazonS3Bucket] ❌ Missing relationships: [All connections from AWS Service to other services are missing red arrows; AWS Service lacks explicit connections to subgraphs]  

## RECOMMENDATIONS  
1. **Add AWS Service as a distinct node** outside subgraphs with explicit red arrows to all downstream services (S3, DynamoDB, EC2, ECS, CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, RDS).  
2. **Incorporate Security Group as a standalone subgraph** with connections to relevant services (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3).  
3. **Apply red arrows to all connections originating from AWS Service** to ensure alignment with the analysis.  
4. **Refine subgraph organization** to explicitly group security controls (e.g., Security Group) alongside compute/storage services.  
5. **Validate node styling** for red arrows and ensure spatial relationships match the original diagram’s layout.  

The code fails to capture the AWS Service as a distinct component, omits the Security Group entirely, and misrepresents connection styling for critical flows. These errors require immediate correction to achieve 100% fidelity.
