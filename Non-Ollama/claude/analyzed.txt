AWS Diagram Example: Detailed Description

1. Entry Points:
   - www.example.com: Represented by an orange cross-like icon
   - media.example.com: Represented by a red circular icon with arrows
   - Text "CloudFront Distribution" is associated with media.example.com

2. Load Balancing:
   - Elastic Load Balancing: An orange circular icon with arrows
   - Connected to the Auto Scaling group via an arrow

3. Availability Zone:
   - Large orange dashed rectangle encompassing most of the infrastructure
   - Labeled "Availability Zone" at the bottom

4. Auto Scaling Group:
   - Pink dashed rectangle within the Availability Zone
   - Contains:
     a. Security Group: Inner rounded rectangle with an orange box icon, labeled "Security Group"
     b. Root Volume: Red cylindrical icon labeled "Root Volume"
     c. Data Volume: Red cylindrical icon labeled "Data Volume"

5. Connections from Auto Scaling Group:
   - Arrow labeled "Logs" from Auto Scaling group to Amazon S3 Bucket
   - Arrow from Data Volume to Amazon EBS Snapshot

6. Storage Components:
   - Amazon EBS Snapshot: Small red bucket-like icon outside Auto Scaling group but within Availability Zone
   - Amazon S3 Bucket: Larger red bucket icon for storage, outside Availability Zone
   - Arrow connecting Amazon EBS Snapshot to Amazon S3 Bucket

7. Additional Security:
   - Another security group: Blue square icon with "M" inside, outside the Auto Scaling Group but within the Availability Zone

8. Diagram Flow:
   - Traffic enters through www.example.com and media.example.com
   - Passes through Elastic Load Balancing
   - Directed to Auto Scaling Group within Availability Zone
   - Data stored in Root Volume and Data Volume
   - Data Volume connected to Amazon EBS Snapshot for backups
   - Logs from Auto Scaling Group stored in Amazon S3 Bucket
   - Media content likely served through CloudFront Distribution

This diagram illustrates a typical AWS web application architecture with emphasis on scalability, availability, and data management. It shows how different AWS services interact to create a resilient infrastructure, including load balancing, auto-scaling, security groups, and separate storage solutions for data and logs.
