AWS Diagram Example

This cloud architecture diagram illustrates an AWS (Amazon Web Services) setup. The diagram uses a color scheme of primarily orange, red, and blue on a white background. Here's a detailed description of all elements:

1. Title: "AWS Diagram Example" is prominently displayed at the top of the image.

2. External Components:
   - Left side: An orange cross-shaped icon labeled "www.example.com"
   - Right side: A red circular icon with a downward arrow, labeled "media.example.com"

3. Elastic Load Balancing:
   - Represented by an orange circular icon with multiple arrows pointing inward and outward
   - Located to the left of the main architecture
   - Connected to www.example.com and the internal components

4. Main Architecture:
   - Enclosed in a large orange dashed rectangle labeled "Availability Zone" at the bottom

5. Auto Scaling Group:
   - Inside the Availability Zone, there's a pink dashed rectangle labeled "Auto Scaling Group"
   - Contains a "Security Group" (orange rectangle) and two volumes

6. Security Group:
   - Represented by an orange rectangle within the Auto Scaling Group

7. Volumes:
   - Two red cylinder-shaped icons labeled "Root Volume" and "Data Volume"
   - Located to the right of the Security Group within the Auto Scaling Group

8. Additional Security Group:
   - Below the Auto Scaling Group, there's a blue cylinder icon with "M" inside
   - Labeled "security group" (lowercase) and enclosed in a red dashed rectangle

9. Amazon EBS Snapshot:
   - Represented by a small red icon shaped like a bucket
   - Located to the right of the Availability Zone
   - Connected to the Data Volume
   - Labeled "Amazon EB S Snapshot" (with a space in "EBS")

10. Amazon S3 Bucket:
    - Large red bucket-shaped icon on the far right
    - Labeled "Amazon S3 Bucket"
    - Connected to the EBS Snapshot and receiving "Logs" directly from the Auto Scaling Group

11. CloudFront Distribution:
    - Text running vertically along the right side of the diagram
    - Connects media.example.com to the Amazon S3 Bucket
    - Contains a dotted downward arrow symbol inside the icon

12. Connections:
    - Black arrows show the flow of data between components
    - A "Logs" arrow directly connects the Auto Scaling Group to the S3 Bucket

The diagram effectively illustrates the flow of data and the relationships between different AWS services and components in a cloud architecture setup. It shows how external requests from www.example.com are routed through Elastic Load Balancing to an Auto Scaling Group within an Availability Zone. The Auto Scaling Group contains a Security Group and manages Root and Data Volumes. The Data Volume is connected to an Amazon EBS Snapshot, which in turn connects to an Amazon S3 Bucket. The S3 Bucket also receives logs directly from the Auto Scaling Group. On the right side, media.example.com connects to the S3 Bucket via a CloudFront Distribution, likely for content delivery. An additional security group is depicted below the main Auto Scaling Group, possibly for extra security measures or management purposes.
