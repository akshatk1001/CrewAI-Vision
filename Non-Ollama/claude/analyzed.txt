Azure Architecture Diagram

The diagram depicts an Azure cloud architecture with the following components and structure:

1. Title:
   "Azure Architecture Diagram" in a light gray box with diagonal striped background at the top.

2. Main Components (left to right):

   a. Traffic Manager Profiles:
      - Purple octagonal icon with arrows pointing in different directions

   b. Application Load Balancers (ALB):
      - Three green diamond-shaped icons with arrows pointing outwards
      - Positioned between major tiers of the architecture

   c. Web Tier:
      - Box containing three identical VM (Virtual Machine) icons
      - Each VM represented by a computer monitor with a blue cube inside
      - Labeled "VM" underneath each icon

   d. Business Tier:
      - Similar to Web Tier, contains three VM icons labeled "VM"

   e. SQL Server Database On:
      - Contains two SQL database icons
      - Each database represented by a blue cylinder with "SQL" text and a small gear icon

3. Connections:
   - Gray arrows connect components from left to right
   - Traffic Manager connects to the first ALB
   - First ALB connects to all three VMs in Web Tier
   - Web Tier connects to second ALB
   - Second ALB connects to all three VMs in Business Tier
   - Business Tier connects to third ALB
   - Third ALB connects to both SQL databases

4. Management Subnet:
   - Located at the bottom of the diagram
   - Contains two icons:
     a. Jumpbox: Computer monitor with a blue cube inside
     b. Active Directory: Light blue icon with three connected dots

5. Visual Style:
   - White background with minimalist design
   - Components grouped in rectangular boxes with labels at the top
   - Color scheme: Purple (Traffic Manager), Green (ALBs), Light Blue (VMs), Dark Blue (SQL databases)
   - Management Subnet separated from main flow

This diagram illustrates a multi-tiered Azure application architecture with load balancing, separated web and business logic tiers, a database backend, and management components for administration and security.
