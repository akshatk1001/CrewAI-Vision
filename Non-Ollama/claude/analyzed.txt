      - Located near media.example.com

4. Connections and Data Flow:
   - www.example.com → Elastic Load Balancing → Availability Zone
   - Data Volume → Amazon EB S Snapshot → Amazon S3 Bucket
   - Availability Zone ("Logs") → Amazon S3 Bucket
   - Amazon S3 Bucket → media.example.com
   - Cloud Front Distribution (implied connection to media.example.com)

5. Color Scheme:
   - Orange: User-facing components (www.example.com, Elastic Load Balancing)
